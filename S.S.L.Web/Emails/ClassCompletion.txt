                <p>Congratulations on completing the Sacred Secular League(SSL) foundation classes.</p>
                <p> We commend your efforts and commitment throughout the period of training and we trust that you have a better understanding of our vision of projecting righteousness in our secular spaces.
                </p>

                <p>We encourage you by the grace of God to practice all you have been taught and will be taught towards actualizing your Primary Assignment (PA). 
                    You will be assigned shortly to an SSL GYM group to further facilitate edification and mentorship.
                </p>
                <p>Just as you have finished this phase successfully, we declare that you will successfully finish every good thing you have started and will start.
                    </p>

                <p>We know we are righteous and we act accordingly.
                    </p>
