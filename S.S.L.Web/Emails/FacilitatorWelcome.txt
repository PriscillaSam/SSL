			<p style=" font-size: 17px"><strong>Dear {user},</strong></p>
			<p>Congratulations on your new role as a Sacred Secular League (SSL) facilitator. <br>SSL believes in the Grace of God at work in your life. This is the reason we have called you to function in this capacity of mentoring others.
				</p>
			<p>This role is an honour as well as a huge responsibility. It has become a direct responsibility for you to  teach everyone who will be assigned to you until they are baptized fully in the knowledge and power of God's agenda in the league.
				</p>
				<p>Necessity is now laid on you to indeed be a role model in the secular ministry. <br>
					Other necessary information will be communicated to you subsequently.
					</p>
					<p>We know we are righteous and we act accordingly.
						</p>
